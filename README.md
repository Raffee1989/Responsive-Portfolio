## Description:
This homework was intended to test my overall HTML, CSS and Bootstrap knowledge. First look, I found it easy but it was very tricky once I started working on it. I had to create a portfolio webpage. Basically I had to work on three HTML files. Each page had to have its conditions in three different screen sizes. I was provided with each screen size's images.
