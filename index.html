        <h2>Hello! <br>I'm Raffee.</h2>
        <p>
          My full name is Abouzar Raffee. I was born in Kabul, Afghanistan but I currently reside in Sacramento, California. I graduated from Ghazi High School in Kabul in 2007 but soon started a full time job. I was able to get my Associate Degree in Computer Technology Institute of Kabul, Afghanistan in 2013.

          I have been employed in Volt Workforce Solution as a material handler since 2017. That was the year I came to the United States holding  special immigrant visas along with my family. I worked for Moby Group as Translation Section Manager in Kabul, Afghanistan for five years (2012-2017). Before that I worked for Omran Holding Group as a Submittal Officer in Kabul, Afghanistan for two years (2010-2012); and finally my first job was as Interpreter with DynCorp International in Kunduz, Afghanistan (2008-2009).
        </p>

          When I am free, I enjoy spending time like traveling, camping and biking with family. I like to play video games (FIFA) with my friends. Listening to pop music touches my heart whenever I am alone. Overall, I love to breathe the technology by testing, expanding and updating my knowledge in this field. 
        </p>
              
        <p>
          Therefore, I am currently enrolled in UC Davis Coding Bootcamp. I invested whatever I had to fulfil my dream as a Full Stack Developer or commonly Web Developer. I like coding as it is more logical. You will have a wonderful output if you struggle wonderfully. It is all about concentration. Besides, web development has a variety of job opportunities nowadays. I am super excited and hopeful about my new skill.
